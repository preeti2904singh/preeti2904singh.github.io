				<h5>BUSINESS ANALYTICS DASHBOARD</h5><br/>	
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Problem</b></span><br>
					Hotelsoft's product offers business intelligence reports that require revenue managers to indulge on a daily basis in their rate choices. Analytics of the platform showed less than 25 percent of the daily logging users.
				</div>
				<img class="imageBlock" src="images/drive_engagement.png">
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Research</b></span><br>
					<p>Initial web analytics also showed that users did not remain on the present homepage as users logged in to define significant information points, we performed semi-structured interviews and analysis of competitors. This assisted us to prioritize information points and also to define metrics that would influence them.</p>

					<h5>INSIGHTS</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Instead of navigating through the interface to various locations, clients anticipated seeing information overview at one location within the product before digging deeper into specific details.</li>
						<li>Customers pointed out that daily pickups, the pace for the coming months and the Occupancy+ADR+Revenues trio are the most frequently accessed data points that provide the required daily information.</li>
						<li>Users like to view data through <b> month-to-date (MTD) or year-to-date (YTD) timeframes</b> and <b> market segment and source drill-downs</b>.</li>
						<li>A regular email about comparable summary would urge customers to "learn more, capture and correct" information anomalies that would occur in their inner systems.</li>

				<h5>PRICE OPTIMIZER PRODUCT LAUNCH</h5>	<br/>
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Problem</b></span><br>
					It is very laborious and time-consuming to integrate a hospitality property with an application for revenue management. It needs continuous human involvement and back and forth between both sides for weeks (sometimes months).
				</div>
				<br/>
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Research</b></span><br>
					<p>We looked at different parts of the onboarding process of existing customers and studied broken parts that presently require human involvement and time-consuming processes.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div><br/>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
					<h5>INSIGHTS</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Revenue management apps require property information such as stock, occupancy and income, etc., to be integrated into a property in distinctive formats. This method of turning the information of each hotel into a unified configuration was the most time-consuming method for an application for revenue management.</li>
						<li>Hoteliers have shifted from season-based pricing to market-based pricing with quick-moving moments. This change in trend meant less participation during onboarding between the application for revenue management and assets.</li>
						<li>A pattern was noted where a prevalent definition for competitor hotels was defined by clients as properties within 25 mile radius and with a comparable star rating.</li>

				</div>

				<div class="infoCard infoCardYellow" data-aos="fade-left" >
					<h5>SOLUTION</h5>
					<p>We have achieved a straightforward workflow system after numerous iterations of overcoming design and technical difficulties, where a hotelier can be signed up and access a recommendation platform based on market rates within minutes.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="infoCard infoCardGreen" data-aos="fade-left" >
					<h5>RESULT</h5>
					<p>Within the first month of product launch, 10 hotels signed up. While traditional integration of revenue management occurs in the background, from day one income executives enjoy full-fledged rate suggestions and rateshop characteristics.</p>

					<span class="small-head"><b>Problem</b></span><br>
					In the Hotelsoft product, I recognized scope for design standardization. There was a lack of UI consistency and cohesiveness in existing parts.

					<p>With the objective of maintaining consistency and standardizing workflows, we decided to borrow one of the industry's finest design languages to move rapidly.</p>

					<p>From the smallest parts, we introduced modifications and gradually shifted to bigger ones.

Futuristic mobile-friendly designs were also given way to this.</p>

				<h5>DATA TABLES ADVANCEMENT</h5>	<br/>

					Complex table structures of information did not comply with norms of usability.

					<span class="small-head"><b>Research</b></span><br>
					<p>Hotelsoft platform offers hoteliers with highly data-intensive analytical reports, much of which includes tables with distinct data types, filtering and sorting systems, page navigation, and more.Using in-product feedback tool, customers were advised that experience on legacy information tables was at times sluggish and unusable. To find out about client frustrations, we performed further distant contextual investigations.</p>

				<div>
					<h5>INSIGHTS</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>In slow charging tables, inconsistent placement of information units and uncertain navigation, customer feedback showed frustrations.</li>
						<li>Revenue executives used Microsoft Excel sheets to work with. They were expecting comparable performance from our web interfaces and characteristics.</li>
						<li>Inline table editing has become a pain for users as various cells have been updated simultaneously.</li>
						<li>Users either wished to see additional drill down or metadata on the displayed information points. Existing tables did not do justice to the behaviors mentioned above, leaving consumers to guess.</li>
						<li>Lack of pivoting, grouping and filtering capacities compelled users to export reports to desired formats and then proceed to do so. This defeated the objective of the item offering value.</li>

				<h5>CUSTOMER FEEDBACK METHODS</h5>	<br/>
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Problem</b></span><br>
					The feedback and support loop were slowed down by a lack of communication channels.
				</div>
				<br/>
				<div class="contentSection">
					<span class="small-head"><b>Research</b></span><br>
					<p>When clients confronted problems, they either reached out via email or waited for weekly check-in calls to our support team.Support would reach out to the technical and product team, resolve problems and then return to clients. After shadowing client meetings, interviewing with inner support teams and product teams, several pain points were observed in this phase.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
					<h5>INSIGHTS</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>When shared over lengthy email chains, key data about problems was lost</li>
						<li>Time is taken for a client to discover an information issue and communicate it to help the team typically meant stacking it until a weekly call occurred.</li>

					<h5>GOAL</h5>
					<p>Create quicker channels for communication and feedback.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="infoCard infoCardYellow" data-aos="fade-left" >
					<h5>SOLUTION</h5> <br/>
					<p> 
						<b>Iteration 1</b>   <br/>
						As Slack was strongly used as our internal communication channel, the best first move seemed to be to integrate feedback messages. We have intended an in-house tool that is available to clients all the time.
					</p> <br/>
					<p> 
						<b>Iteration 2</b>   <br/>
						Although Slack helped us to communicate faster, the ability to continue the discussion was lacking. The loop to get the issue sorted continued to take place via email/meetings after a customer's first email.First iteration seemed half baked and we began to look for something better. This is when a need was realized to have an entirely exclusive support tool and Slack did not seem to fit the bill. We decided to look for the finest support instruments from the sector and finished with tawk.to.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="infoCard infoCardGreen" data-aos="fade-left" >
					<h5>RESULT</h5>
					<p>Adding support tool assisted our clients with our team to have live chats. Supporting ticketing and monitoring enhanced the confidence of clients.</p>
